Explanation:

Since most queries filter by dept, we use partitioning to optimize performance. This reduces full table scans by limiting queries to relevant partitions.

SQL Implementation:

ALTER TABLE item_loc_soh MODIFY PARTITION BY RANGE (dept)
(
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (25),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (50),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (75),
    PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN (100),
    PARTITION pmax VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
