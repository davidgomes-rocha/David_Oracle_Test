This repository contains SQL scripts and PL/SQL implementations for various Oracle APEX test questions. Each question has a dedicated file where I have provided solutions, optimizations, and explanations.

During this process, I encountered some challenges due to my limited familiarity with Oracle APEX. I initially attempted to run certain procedures and file-handling operations using Oracle SQL Developer from my company. While this helped me validate most SQL queries, some APEX-specific functionalities—such as CSV exports using UTL_FILE—were not executable in my environment due to Oracle APEX restrictions on file system access.

This repository serves as a reference for Oracle SQL and PL/SQL solutions, with considerations for APEX-specific constraints. While I was able to test most solutions in Oracle SQL Developer, I encountered APEX limitations that prevented full execution in certain areas. Feedback and improvements are welcome!
