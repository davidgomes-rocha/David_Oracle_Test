Objective

The goal is to optimize queries on the item_loc_soh table by improving performance through indexes and analyzing execution plans using EXPLAIN PLAN.

Analysis of the Execution Plan:
-TABLE ACCESS FULL on ITEM_LOC_SOH â†’ reading the entire table to find matching rows.
-Filtering by LOC and DEPT is not effective without an index.


Since the test mentions that users frequently search by dept, and queries often filter using loc, we need to:
-Ensure efficient indexing to speed up searches.
-Avoid Full Table Scans (FTS) that degrade performance.
-Use EXPLAIN PLAN to analyze how queries are executed and improve them accordingly.
-Create INDEX since users frequently search by LOC and DEPT.

SQL Implementation:

CREATE INDEX idx_item_loc_soh_loc_dept ON item_loc_soh (loc, dept);

******Error while creating********
Error at line 1/43: ORA-01536: space quota exceeded for tablespace 'APEX_BIGFILE_INSTANCE_TBS3'
1. CREATE INDEX idx_item_loc_soh_loc_dept ON item_loc_soh (loc, dept);
******

EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
SELECT * FROM item_loc_soh WHERE loc = 101 AND dept = 84;
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY);


Notes:
I couldn't see the explain plan in the apex....
