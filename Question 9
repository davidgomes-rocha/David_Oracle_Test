Objective

The goal is to optimize queries on the item_loc_soh table by improving performance through indexes and analyzing execution plans using EXPLAIN PLAN.

Since the test mentions that users frequently search by dept, and queries often filter using loc, we need to:
-Ensure efficient indexing to speed up searches.
-Avoid Full Table Scans (FTS) that degrade performance.
-Use EXPLAIN PLAN to analyze how queries are executed and improve them accordingly.

SQL Implementation:

CREATE INDEX idx_item_loc_soh_loc_dept ON item_loc_soh (loc, dept);

EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
SELECT * FROM item_loc_soh WHERE loc = 652 AND dept = 68;
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY);
