3. Your suggestion to avoid row contention at table level parameter because of high level of concurrency

Explanation:

To reduce contention and improve concurrency:

-Enable Row Movement → Allows Oracle to rebalance data.
-Use Row-Level Locks → Prevents unnecessary full-table locks.

SQL Implementation:

ALTER TABLE item_loc_soh ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;
LOCK TABLE item_loc_soh IN ROW SHARE MODE;
