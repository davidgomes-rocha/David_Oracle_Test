7. Create a data filter mechanism that can be used at screen level to filter out the data that user can see accordingly to dept association (created previously)

Objective
The goal is to restrict user access to stock data based on their assigned departments. This ensures that:
-Users can only view data relevant to their role.
-Unauthorized users cannot access sensitive stock information.
-The system maintains data security and performance efficiency by filtering results at the database level.

How the Filtering Mechanism Works:
-We have a user_dept table that defines which departments each user is allowed to access. (table created at question 5)
-The function user_dept_filter returns a filtered dataset:
  -It retrieves stock data only for the departments that a given user is authorized to view.
  -Returns a SYS_REFCURSOR (a pointer to a dataset) that can be used in an APEX report, application, or another procedure.

PL/SQL Implementation:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION user_dept_filter(p_user_id VARCHAR2) RETURN SYS_REFCURSOR AS
    v_cursor SYS_REFCURSOR;
BEGIN
    OPEN v_cursor FOR
    SELECT ils.*
    FROM item_loc_soh ils
    JOIN user_dept ud ON ils.dept = ud.dept
    WHERE ud.user_id = p_user_id;

    RETURN v_cursor;
END;
